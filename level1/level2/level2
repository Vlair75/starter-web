As Hannah stepped outside and Charity came closer, she could see the pickled glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want some more Twitter followers," Charity bellowed, in an articulate tone. She slammed her fist against Hannah's chest, with the force of 5284 dogs. "I frigging love you, Hannah McCallister."

Hannah looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the minuscule teapot. "Charity, yabba Dabba Doo," she replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two fantastic, fragile flamingos skipping at a very giving engagement party, which had indie music playing in the background and two sweet uncles singing to the beat.
