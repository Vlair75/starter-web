Suddenly, Charity lunged forward and tried to punch Hannah in the face. Quickly, Hannah grabbed the minuscule teapot and brought it down on Charity's skull.

Charity's wobbly ankles trembled and her blonde fingers wobbled. She looked surprised, her body raw like a mangled, melodic map.

Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Charity Bond was dead.

Hannah McCallister went back inside and made herself a nice glass of brandy.
