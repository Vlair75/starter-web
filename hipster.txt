	Zach Thomas was thinking about Alison Nolan again. Alison was a brave angel with fluffy eyes and pretty warts.

	Zach walked over to the window and reflected on his beautiful surroundings. He had always loved creepy Upper Boggington with its nasty, nervous nooks. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel sad.

	Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a brave figure of Alison Nolan.
