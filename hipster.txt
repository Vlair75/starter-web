Hannah McCallister had always loved grey West Boggins with its foolish, faithful fields. It was a place where she felt cross.

She was a courageous, charming, brandy drinker with squat ankles and fat fingers. Her friends saw her as a wild, wasteful writer. Once, she had even revived a dying, owl. That's the sort of woman he was.

Hannah walked over to the window and reflected on her dull surroundings. The wind blew like chatting koalas.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Charity Bond. Charity was an intuitive author with wobbly ankles and blonde fingers.

Hannah gulped. She was not prepared for Charity.

As Hannah stepped outside and Charity came closer, she could see the pickled glint in her eye.

"I am here because I want some more Twitter followers," Charity bellowed, in an articulate tone. She slammed her fist against Hannah's chest, with the force of 5284 dogs. "I frigging love you, Hannah McCallister."

Hannah looked back, even more anxious and still fingering the minuscule teapot. "Charity, yabba Dabba Doo," she replied.

They looked at each other with sad feelings, like two fantastic, fragile flamingos skipping at a very giving engagement party, which had indie music playing in the background and two sweet uncles singing to the beat.

Suddenly, Charity lunged forward and tried to punch Hannah in the face. Quickly, Hannah grabbed the minuscule teapot and brought it down on Charity's skull.

Charity's wobbly ankles trembled and her blonde fingers wobbled. She looked surprised, her body raw like a mangled, melodic map.

Then she let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Charity Bond was dead.

Hannah McCallister went back inside and made herself a nice glass of brandy.
